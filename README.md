# Data_Structure-in-cpp
Data structures concept and company related questions with detailed solutions. 

This Repository is my personal development coading cycle that i'll be going through to get ready for my placements, i'll try to be uploading new content everyday what is learn and shall provide with the different resources too that i would be using to get better with my code. Will try to provide the problem that have been asked in the interviews related to the particular datastructure and will try to provide detail solution to those problem.

In abstract terms, a data structure refers to a way of organizing and storing data to facilitate efficient access, modification, and retrieval operations. It provides a conceptual framework and defines the relationships and interactions between the data elements.

### Data structures are designed to suit specific needs and optimize various operations performed on the data. They can be classified into different types, each with its own characteristics, advantages, and limitations. Some commonly used data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables.

The choice of a data structure depends on the requirements of the problem at hand. For example, if the primary concern is fast retrieval of data based on an index, an array or a hash table may be suitable. On the other hand, if the focus is on efficient insertion and deletion operations, a linked list or a tree structure might be more appropriate.

Abstractly, data structures are often represented using mathematical models, such as graphs or abstract data types. These models provide a high-level view of the data organization without getting into implementation details. They allow us to reason about the behavior and properties of data structures, such as time and space complexity, without considering the specific programming language or hardware environment.

By understanding different data structures and their characteristics, programmers can choose the most appropriate one to optimize the performance of their algorithms and solve problems efficiently. Data structures play a crucial role in computer science and software development, enabling the creation of robust and efficient applications.
